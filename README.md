# gpull
###### A git repository management tool.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joergen7/gpull.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joergen7/gpull)

## Usage

### Pulling Changes

This command line tool updates (or clones if necessary) a possibly large number of git repositories from different sources by entering

    gpull

on the command line. This results in an output that looks like this:

    =====================================
    repo:   variant_call_rna
    URL:    https://github.com/joergen7/variant_call_rna.git
    action: git pull
    Already up-to-date.
    =====================================
    repo:   wordcount
    URL:    https://github.com/joergen7/wordcount.git
    action: git pull
    Already up-to-date.

### The Repository Information File

The repository information is drawn from a file `repo_info.json` which is expected in the current working directory.

The `repo_info.json` file contains a JSON object associating a base URL string with a list of repository name strings. E.g., the following JSON object is a valid repo info object:

    {"https://github.com/joergen7" :
       ["bismark", "bsmooth-align", "cf-java", "cf-model", "cf_client",
        "cf_lang", "cf_reference", "cf_worker", "cfif", "cfui",
        "chef-bioinf-worker", "chef-cuneiform", "chef-misc", "chip-seq",
        "consensus-prediction", "cre", "cuneiform", "cuneiform-doc",
        "cuneiform-legacy", "effi", "gccount", "gen_pnet", "gen_pnet_examples",
        "gen_workflow", "gpull", "gruff", "gruff_example", "kmeans",
        "lib_combin", "lib_conf", "lib_dp", "metagenomics", "methylation",
        "mirdeep", "mirna-discovery", "phylogeny", "pn", "rna-seq",
        "variant-call", "variant-call-gatk", "variant_call_rna", "wordcount"
       ]}

The base URL string is prepended to each repository name to build the repository URL.

### Surveying Repository Statuses

In addition it is possible to detect which local repositories have changed by entering

    gpull status

on the command line. This results in an output that looks like this:

    =====================================
    repo:   gpull
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

A notification is generated only for repositories that contain uncommitted changes.

## Building with Rebar3

Build the command line tool by entering

    rebar3 escriptize

Install the resulting script by copying it to a location in the executable path, e.g., by entering

    sudo cp _build/default/bin/gpull /usr/local/bin

## System Requirements

- [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) OTP 18.0 or higher
