# gpull
###### A git repository management tool.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joergen7/gpull.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joergen7/gpull)

This command line tool updates (or clones if necessary) a possibly large number of git repositories from different sources by entering

    gpull

on the command line. The repository information is drawn from a file `repo_info.json` which is expected in the current working directory.

The `repo_info.json` file contains a JSON object associating a base URL string with a list of repository name strings. E.g., the following JSON object is a valid repo info object:

    {"https://github.com/joergen7" :
       ["bismark", "bsmooth-align", "cf-java", "cf-model", "cf_client",
        "cf_lang", "cf_reference", "cf_worker", "cfif", "cfui",
        "chef-bioinf-worker", "chef-cuneiform", "chef-misc", "chip-seq",
        "consensus-prediction", "cre", "cuneiform", "cuneiform-doc",
        "cuneiform-legacy", "effi", "gccount", "gen_pnet", "gen_pnet_examples",
        "gen_workflow", "gpull", "gruff", "gruff_example", "kmeans",
        "lib_combin", "lib_conf", "lib_dp", "metagenomics", "methylation",
        "mirdeep", "mirna-discovery", "phylogeny", "pn", "rna-seq",
        "variant-call", "variant-call-gatk", "variant_call_rna", "wordcount"
       ]}

The base URL string is prepended to each repository name to build the repository URL.

In addition it is possible to detect which local repositories have changed by entering

    gpull status

on the command line. A notification is generated only for repositories that contain uncommitted changes.

## Building with Rebar3

Build the command line tool by entering

    rebar3 escriptize

Install the resulting script by copying it to a location in the executable path, e.g., by entering

    sudo cp _build/default/bin/gpull /usr/local/bin

## System Requirements

- Erlang OTP 18.0 or higher
- Rebar3 3.0.0 or higher
